convert
-------
The 'convert' utility can be used to transform snapshots, i.e. from one
snapshot format to another, or altering some attribute of the snapshot.
A new snapshot file is always created for the transformed the result, with the
original snapshot untouched.

For a brief description of how to use the convert utility, run

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -u convert -h
