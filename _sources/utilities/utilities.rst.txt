Utilities
=========
Besides running simulations, several related features are built into
CO\ *N*\ CEPT, such as power spectrum computation. While these features are
utilized automatically during a simulation, it is sometimes useful to be able
to utilize them on their own, e.g. producing a power spectrum from a snapshot
file. To this end, CO\ *N*\ CEPT provides various *utilities*, with the
ability to hook into the main code and utilize a given feature, without
running any simulation. In addition, some utilities exist on their own merit,
and introduce features that is not used during simulation.

The available utilities are as follows:
