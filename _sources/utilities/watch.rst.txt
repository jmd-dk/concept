watch utility
-------------
The CO\ *N*\ CEPT 'watch' utility allows you to follow the real-time terminal
output of CO\ *N*\ CEPT jobs running remotely.

For a brief description of how to use the watch utility, run

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -u update -h

Note that when running CO\ *N*\ CEPT remotely, this utility is automatically
called upon job submission (unless explicitly
:ref:`asked not to<watch_cmdoption>`).
