Installation
============
This page contains detailed information about how to install CO\ *N*\ CEPT
along with its many dependencies. Unless you have some special need, it is
recommended to just follow the simple,
:ref:`standard installation<standard_installation>` instructions, including
those covering how to obtain
:ref:`optimal network performance<optimal_network_performance_on_clusters>`
if you intend to install CO\ *N*\ CEPT on a cluster.

The :ref:`standard<standard_installation>` way of installing CO\ *N*\ CEPT
utilizes the ``installer`` script to install CO\ *N*\ CEPT and all of its
dependencies. Many more details about how to use this script for more
customized installation is available under the
':ref:`installer script in-depth<the_installer_script_in_depth>`' entry.

Though not recommended, you may choose to not make use of the ``installer``
script, in which case you need to install all of the
:ref:`dependencies<dependencies>` yourself. After
`downloading <https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept>`_ the CO\ *N*\ CEPT source
code, you then need to
:ref:`specify environment information<the_paths_and_env_files>` by editing
the ``.paths`` and ``.env`` files.

      CO\ *N*\ CEPT should be trivial to install on all major Linux
      distributions. The system may be a laptop, a workstation, a massively
      parallel computer cluster, a Raspberry Pi, a virtual machine, etc.

   .. tab:: |windows| :math:`\,\,` Windows

      Though CO\ *N*\ CEPT does not run on native Windows, support is obtained
      via the
      `Windows Subsytem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_.
      If installing CO\ *N*\ CEPT on Windows this way, make sure to install it
      into a proper Linux directory (e.g. your home directory ``~``) and not a
      Windows directory (e.g. ``/mnt/c/...``).

      The more traditional approach of installing Linux in a virtual machine
      within Windows of course works too.

   .. tab:: |macos| :math:`\,\,` macOS

      Currently the only means of running CO\ *N*\ CEPT on a mac is by
      installing it within a virtual Linux machine.

      Though much of the POSIX infrastructure needed to install and run
      CO\ *N*\ CEPT is available to macOS via `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_,
      numerous incompatibilities between the GNU and BSD tools make the
      porting to macOS non-trivial.




.. _standard_installation:

Standard installation
---------------------
The easiest way to install CO\ *N*\ CEPT along with all of its dependencies is
to use the CO\ *N*\ CEPT ``installer`` Bash script. This script is part of the
CO\ *N*\ CEPT source code, and so if you have CO\ *N*\ CEPT already downloaded,
you may find and run this script:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash installer

However, the simplest way to run the script is to just execute

.. code-block:: bash

   concept_version=master
   bash <(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmd-dk/concept/${concept_version}/installer)

in a terminal, which will fetch and run the ``installer`` script directly from
the CO\ *N*\ CEPT GitHub repository, specifically the master version of the
script, which will install the corresponding master version of CO\ *N*\ CEPT.
Check out the CO\ *N*\ CEPT
`releases <https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept/releases>`_ for other available
release versions, or use ``concept_version=master`` for the absolute newest
(and unstable!) version.

.. note::
   The initial ``bash`` in the above commands is required regardless of your
   shell

.. note::
   For the remainder of this page, we shall make us of the shorter
   ``bash installer`` syntax, but here the local file "``installer``" may
   always be substituted with the online "``<(wget ...)``" version.

The ``installer`` will prompt you for an installation directory, as well as
for permission to install each :ref:`system dependency<system_dependencies>`,
should any be missing. At the very beginning of the installation, a table of
software to be installed will be shown.

CO\ *N*\ CEPT along with all of the libraries it needs will be installed into
the chosen installation directory. To completely remove the CO\ *N*\ CEPT
installation, simply remove this directory.

The installation will take an hour or two on modern hardware and take up
about 1.5 GB of storage. Should the installation process end prematurely
(e.g. if you kill it yourself), simply rerun the installation command and it
will pick up from where it was.



.. _optimal_network_performance_on_clusters:

Optimal network performance on clusters
.......................................
To install CO\ *N*\ CEPT on a cluster, the standard installation procedure
above may be used. However, the performance of simulations running on multiple
processors may be very poor, as the MPI library installed by the ``installer``
may not be configured optimally regarding the network and accompanying
software present on the cluster.

To test the network performance of MPI, you may simply run a small simulation
using 1, 2 and 4 processes. If the various timings printed out by the code
increases significantly as you increase the number of processes, you are
affected by this issue. Furthermore, running a simulation on 2 nodes each with
2 processes should not be significantly slower than running on a single node
with 4 processes, at least not if your cluster features a high-speed network
such as InfiniBand.

If you are affected by this issue, it is recommended to reinstall
CO\ *N*\ CEPT using an MPI library already present on the cluster, presumably
configured optimally by the system administrator. To do this, simply set the
``mpi_dir`` variable to the directory containing this MPI library when
invoking the ``installer``, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   mpi_dir=/path/to/mpi bash installer

Note that you *will* have to reinstall CO\ *N*\ CEPT and its dependencies in
their entirety, if you want to swap out the MPI library.

.. tip::

   If you have ``/path/to/mpi/bin`` already in your ``PATH`` you may use
   simply

   .. code-block:: bash

      mpi_dir="$(which mpicc)" bash installer

   Though ``which mpicc`` does not evaluate exactly to ``/path/to/mpi``, it
   is close enough that the ``installer`` understands it.

For the MPI implementation, CO\ *N*\ CEPT officially supports MPICH and
OpenMPI, though it should not matter much (a CO\ *N*\ CEPT installation
using MVAPICH has been successful at least once). What is important is that
the MPI library used supports the MPI-3 standard.



.. _the_installer_script_in_depth:

The ``installer`` script in-depth
---------------------------------
The ``installer`` script may be run with additional options or influential
environment variables, which can be used to e.g. request for a specific
version of a dependency to be installed, or to skip the installation of a
particular dependency and instead make use of a preinstalled version of the
same library. Before discussing such features, it is good to know exactly
what dependencies are installed.


Programs installed
..................
The ``installer`` partitions all dependencies into *library* and *system*
dependencies. Unless explicitly specified, the ``installer`` installs all
library dependencies regardless of whether these already exist on the system.
The system dependencies consist of standard tools commonly installed
system-wide. If the ``installer`` detects a missing system dependency, it will
prompt for system-wide (root) installation through the package manager on the
system.

The ``installer`` script is able to bootstrap itself up from just Bash, GNU
Core Utilities and a package manager (or just Bash and GNU Core Utilities if
all system dependencies are already present). In addition, it builds all
library dependencies from source, increasing the total number of dependencies
(as many dependencies have other dependencies, and so on). For the absolute
minimum dependency requirements needed to *run* CO\ *N*\ CEPT, see the
:ref:`Dependencies<dependencies>` entry.

The complete set of system dependencies needed/installed by the ``installer``
is:

* **GNU tools**: awk, grep, sed, gzip, tar, wget.
* **Build tools**: gcc, g++, gfortran, glibc, GNU make, as, ld, Linux headers.

The complete list of all library dependencies (and their dependency relations)
installed by the ``installer`` is given below:

* **zlib**
* **FreeType**
* **BLAS** and **LAPACK**
* **MPI**
* **FFTW 3**
* **FFTW 2**
* **ncurses**
* **libffi**
* **Perl**
* **OpenSSL** (depends on Perl)
* **libpng** (depends on zlib)
* **GSL** (depends on BLAS)
* **HDF5** (depends on zlib)
* **GADGET** (depends on MPI, GSL, FFTW 2)
* **Python 3** (depends on zlib)

  - **pip** (depends on OpenSSL, libffi), **setuptools** and **wheel**;
    needed to install the packages below:

    - **Blessings** (depends on ncurses)
    - **Cython**
    - **CythonGSL** (depends on Cython, GSL)
    - **NumPy** (depends on BLAS, LAPACK)
    - **SciPy** (depends on BLAS, LAPACK)
    - **matplotlib** (depends on libpng, FreeType)
    - **MPI4Py** (depends on MPI, Cython)
    - **H5Py** (depends on HDF5 and MPI)
    - **Sphinx**
    - **sphinx-copybutton** (depends on Sphinx)
    - **sphinx_rtd_theme** (depends on Sphinx)
    - **sphinx-tabs** (depends on Sphinx)

* **CLASS** + **classy** (depends on Cython, NumPy)

Finally, CO\ *N*\ CEPT itself depends on MPI, FFTW (3), GADGET, Python,
Blessings, Cython, CythonGSL, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, MPI4Py, H5Py, classy,
Sphinx, sphinx-copybutton, sphinx_rtd_theme, sphinx-tabs.

The ``installer`` installs the
`OpenBLAS <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS>`_ library in order to provide
both BLAS and LAPACK. For MPI, `MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/>`_ (default) or
`OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ is installed. If tests are to be
performed during the installation (see the ``--tests``
:ref:`command-line option<command_line_options>`), the pytest Python package
will be installed as well (needed for testing NumPy and SciPy).



.. _command_line_options:

Command-line options
....................
When invoking the ``installer`` --- whether a local copy or directly off of
GitHub --- you may supply optional command-line arguments, the most useful of
which is probably the installation path. That is,

.. code-block:: bash

   bash installer /path/to/concept

will not prompt you for an installation directory but instead use the supplied
``/path/to/concept``.

Other command-line options to ``installer`` are listed below.

.. raw:: html

   <h6>
     Help:
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       -h
     </span></code>
     ,
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       --help
     </span></code>
   </h6>

This prints out a short description of how to use the ``installer`` script
and then exits. Generally though, this documentation page is much preferable.

.. raw:: html

   <h6>
     Tests:
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       -t
     </span></code>
     ,
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       --tests
     </span></code>
   </h6>

With this option, close to all dependency programs will be tested after their
individual installations. CO\ *N*\ CEPT itself will similarly be tested. On
failure (fatal or non-fatal) of any test, a log file of the test output will
be placed in the installation subdirectory of the given program. Any test
failures will be reported at the end of the entire installation process.

This option is helpful for debugging if it is known that the installation
results in a non-functioning CO\ *N*\ CEPT, but it is unknown which of the
many dependencies does not function correctly. Generally though, this option
is not recommended as it increases the installation time by a couple of hours.

The tests performed on the CO\ *N*\ CEPT code itself are those of

.. code:: python3

   ./concept -t all

and so may also be run at any time after the installation, whether or not the
``--tests`` option was used for th installation. See the ``concept``
:ref:`test<test>` option for further details.


.. raw:: html

   <h6>
     Yes:
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       -y
     </span></code>
     ,
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       --yes
     </span></code>
   </h6>

Assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. Currently
these include only the system-wide installations of system dependencies,
should any be missing. Note that this requires root access.

.. raw:: html

   <h6>
     Fix ssh:
     <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">
       --fix-ssh
     </span></code>
   </h6>

.. warning::
   Do *not* use this option if you seek to install CO\ *N*\ CEPT

Invoking the installer with this option will not install CO\ *N*\ CEPT, but
instead attempt to configure the local ``~/.ssh`` directory of the user for
use with remote jobs running on multiple nodes, as described
:ref:`here<problems_when_using_multiple_nodes>`.



.. _influential_environment_variables:

Influential environment variables
.................................
The behavior of the ``installer`` is governed by a large set of environment
variables. An example is the ``mpi_dir`` variable described in
':ref:`optimal network performance on clusters<optimal_network_performance_on_clusters>`',
through which we can let the ``installer`` make use of a preinstalled MPI
library, rather than letting it install one itself. We can specify ``mpi_dir``
either directly in the invocation of ``installler``;

.. code-block:: bash

   mpi_dir=/path/to/mpi bash installer

or defining it as an environmet variable prior to the invocation;

.. code-block:: bash

   export mpi_dir=/path/to/mpi  # Assuming Bash-like shell
   bash installer

All other influential environment variables may be set in similar ways.



Making use of preinstalled libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make the ``installer`` make use of a preinstalled library rather than
installing it itself, you must set the corresponding ``*_dir`` variable. The
complete list of such variables is: ``blas_dir``, ``class_dir``,
``concept_dir``, ``fftw_dir``, ``fftw_for_gadget_dir``, ``freetype_dir``,
``gadget_dir``, ``gsl_dir``, ``hdf5_dir``, ``libffi_dir``, ``libpng_dir``,
``mpi_dir``, ``ncurses_dir``, ``openssl_dir``, ``perl_dir``,
``python_dir``, ``zlib_dir``.

Note that if using a preinstalled Python distribution ---
``python_dir=/path/to/python`` --- OpenSSL, libffi and ncurses are assumed to
be already installed and build into the Python distribution, as these cannot
be tacked on after Python is build. Also, Python should come with at least pip
built-in. The ``installer`` will install any other missing Python packages.

If e.g. ``mpi_dir`` is set, the value of ``mpi_version`` is not used.



Specifying dependency versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The version of each dependency (and CO\ *N*\ CEPT itself) to install is
specified near the top of the ``installer`` script (look for 'Specification
of software versions'). You may direct the ``installer`` to use other versions
through the ``*_version`` variables. As with the ``*_dir`` variables, these
include ``blas_version``, ``class_version``, ``concept_version``,
``fftw_version``, ``fftw_for_gadget_version``, ``freetype_version``,
``gadget_version``, ``gsl_version``, ``hdf5_version``, ``libffi_version``,
``libpng_version``, ``mpi_version``, ``ncurses_version``, ``openssl_version``,
``perl_version``, ``python_version``, ``zlib_version``. Furthermore, each
Python package also has a version, speficied by ``blessings_version``,
``cython_version``, ``cythongsl_version``, ``h5py_version``,
``matplotlib_version``, ``mpi4py_version``, ``numpy_version``,
``pip_version``, ``pytest_version``, ``scipy_version``,
``setuptools_version``, ``sphinx_version``, ``sphinx_copybutton_version``,
``sphinx_rtd_theme_version``, ``sphinx_tabs_version``, ``wheel_version``.



Choosing compiler precedence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the beginning of the installation, the ``installer`` will locate the
various compilers on the system. Its findings are presented under the
'Compiler precedence' heading. If the installation of a given program fails,
the ``installer`` moves on to the next compiler and tries again, and so on.
This is part of the overall philosophy of the ``installer`` to "try, try
again" if a particular choice of compiler/flags/etc. does not succeed. This is
one reason why the installation can be so time consuming. It does however make
the installation process very robust.

If you wish to have a say in the order in which the compilers are tried out,
you may define the ``compiler_precedence`` variable. To prefer e.g. Intel
compilers and then GNU compilers, set ``compiler_precedence="intel gnu"``.
Only compilers found on the system will be taken into account. Also, say the
system further has e.g. the Clang compiler, this will be tried out also, but
after any compilers specified in ``compiler_precedence``.

The supported compilers --- written in order of default precedence --- are:

- ``specified_mpi``: Use the compilers included in the MPI library
  specified by ``mpi_dir``.

- ``default``: Run as is, without altering the environment. If e.g. the ``CC``
  environment variable is set, this will probably be picked up by the
  installation of the program.

- ``gnu``: The GNU compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran).

- ``clang``: The Clang compilers (clang, clang++).

- ``mpi``: MPI compilers found on the system (mpicc, mpicxx, mpifort, ...).

- ``intel``:  The Intel compilers (icc, icpc, ifort).

- ``cray``: The Cray compilers (craycc, crayCC, crayftn).

-  ``portland``: The Portland compilers (pgcc, pgCC, pgf77, pgf90).

- ``generic``: Non-specific compilers found on the system (cc, c++, fortran).

- ``unset``: Explicitly unset environment variables such as ``CC``, ``CXX``,
  ``FC``.

Many of the dependency programs do some compiler discovery of their own, and
so no guarantee of what compiler is actually used can be given.



.. _installing_mpich_or_openmpi:

Installing MPICH or OpenMPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you let the ``installer`` install its own MPI library (i.e. leave
``mpi_dir`` unspecified), you may choose between MPICH and OpenMPI by setting
either ``mpi=mpich`` or ``mpi=openmpi``. If ``mpi`` is left unset, MPICH is
installed. Note that the same variable ``mpi_version`` thus refer to both the
version of MPICH and of OpenMPI.



Parallel builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Much of the installation process can be sped up if we allow the make utility
to build in parallel. This is controlled through the ``make_jobs`` variable.
To enforce serial builds, set ``make_jobs="-j 1"``. To enforce parallel builds
using e.g. 2 processors, specify ``make_jobs="-j 2"``. You can also specify an
unlimited amount of available parallel processors using just
``make_jobs="-j"``.

By default, when ``make_jobs`` is not specified, unlimited parallel builds are
used if installing locally, while serial builds are used if working remotely.



Using the ``installer`` to install specific libraries but not CONCEPT itself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``installer`` script may be used outside the context of CO\ *N*\ CEPT,
should you be in need of any of the dependencies for some other purpose. Which
programs to install is governed by ``*_install`` variables. By default,
``concept_install=True``, which in turn sets ``*_install=True`` for its
immidiate dependencies, which in turn sets ``*_install=True`` for their
dependencies, and so on. If you run the ``installer`` with
``concept_install=False``, nothing will be installed.

To install e.g. just FFTW, use

.. code-block:: bash

   concept_install=False fftw_install=True bash installer

possibly adding in a specific version (``fftw_version=...``) and an MPI
library (``mpi_dir=...`` or ``mpi_install=True``) to link against. As FFTW
does not absolutely need MPI, ``mpi_install`` is not set by having
``fftw_install=True``.

To install GADGET, use

.. code-block:: bash

   concept_install=False gadget_install=True bash installer

This time, MPI, GSL and FFTW (2) will be installed as well, as these are hard
dependencies.



.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
------------
This entry lists the dependency stack of CO\ *N*\ CEPT. Knowledge about this
stack is not needed if using the installation script (*highly* recommended!),
but it is important if for some reason you want to build (parts of) this stack
yourself.

Typically the exact version of any given dependency is not crucial. An effort
is made to ensure that CO\ *N*\ CEPT functions with the newest stable versions
of each dependency. As many of the CO\ *N*\ CEPT dependencies also depend on
each other, finding a working set of dependency versions may be non-trivial.
You may draw inspiration from the current or older versions of the
`installation script <https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept/blob/master/installer>`_
(look for 'Specification of software versions').



Python dependencies
...................
The CO\ *N*\ CEPT source depends explicitly on
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ version 3.6 or newer, together with the
following Python packages (many of which have heavy dependencies of their
own):

* `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_: Needed for transpilation (*cythonization*)
  of the pure Python source code of CO\ *N*\ CEPT into equivalent C code.

* `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_: Provides the basic array types used for
  representing all primary data, together with various array/math functions.

* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_: Provides various numerical methods and
  additional math functions.

* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_: Provides plotting functionality for
  2D and 3D figures, as well as color transformations used for colored
  terminal output.

* `MPI4Py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/>`_: Provides Python bindings for
  MPI, used for all inter-process communication.

* `H5Py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_: Provides Python bindings for
  `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_, used for various binary
  input/output.

* `CythonGSL <https://github.com/twiecki/CythonGSL>`_: Provides Cython
  bindings for `GSL <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_, used for more
  performant replacements of some NumPy/SciPy functionalities when running
  CO\ *N*\ CEPT in compiled mode.

* `Blessings <https://github.com/erikrose/blessings>`_: Provides terminal
  formatting.

In addition, the `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_,
`sphinx-copybutton <https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/>`_,
`sphinx_rtd_theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_ and
`sphinx-tabs <https://github.com/djungelorm/sphinx-tabs/>`_ Python packages
are needed to build the documentation, but may otherwise be left out.



Other primary dependencies
..........................
In addition to Python, the Python packages listed above and their respective
dependencies, CO\ *N*\ CEPT further depends explicitly on
`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_ 3 for its distributed FFT capabilities.

.. note::
   CO\ *N*\ CEPT does not make use of the Python bindings
   `pyFFTW <https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW>`_ for FFTW, as these do not
   include the distributed (MPI) FFT's needed. Instead, CO\ *N*\ CEPT provides
   its own minimal wrapper, ``fft.c``. This is the only C file in the primary
   CO\ *N*\ CEPT source code.

If building FFTW yourself, remember to link against an MPI library. The same
goes for building HDF5 and installing MPI4Py and H5Py. Also, the MPI library
has to conform to the MPI-3 standard.

For testing, CO\ *N*\ CEPT compares itself against
`GADGET <https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/>`_, specifically version
2.0.7. If you do not care about running the CO\ *N*\ CEPT test suite, you do
not have to install GADGET.

The last non-standard depenency of CO\ *N*\ CEPT is the
`CLASS <http://class-code.net/>`_ code, along with its Python wrapper
'classy'. When installing using the installation script, CLASS and classy are
patched in order to enable larger and new kinds of output, fix bugs and
improve interoperability with CO\ *N*\ CEPT. If installing without the use of
the installation script, you will have to obtain the patched CLASS + classy by
some other means. A good solution is to install everything else first,
including CO\ *N*\ CEPT itself, and then make use of the CO\ *N*\ CEPT
``update`` utility to install and patch CLASS + classy:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -u update --class <version>

Here, ``<version>`` should be replaced with the CO\ *N*\ CEPT version whose
``installer`` script should be used to install and patch CLASS + classy.



.. _system_dependencies:

System dependencies
...................
In addition to the many dependencies above, CO\ *N*\ CEPT further uses a lot
of *system dependencies*, by which is meant programs that usually is installed
system-wide. These include `Bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ 3.0 or
newer, the `GNU Core Utilities <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`_
and the `GNU Find Utilities <https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/>`_, which
are the only three that cannot be installed by the ``installer``. The GNU Find
Utilities are only used for building the documentation and may be left out.
That said, all three of these system dependencies comes preinstalled on
virtually all Linux distributions.

Other system dependencies needed for the core CO\ *N*\ CEPT functionality are
awk, grep and sed. Also, the ``installer`` script and ``update`` utility
further makes use of gzip, tar and wget. That is, you may run simulations
without these last three components installed. If running the ``installer``
script or ``update`` utility without these, you will be prompted for
system-wide (root) installation.

Lastly, CO\ *N*\ CEPT needs standard tools for compiling and linking C (C99)
code. An ``mpicc`` C compiler/linker should be bundled with the MPI library
used. The GNU make utility is also needed.



.. _the_paths_and_env_files:

The ``.paths`` and ``.env`` files
---------------------------------
The ``.paths`` file and the ``.env`` file are special files storing static
information about the CO\ *N*\ CEPT installation. The ``.paths`` file store
absolute paths to various files and directories, while the ``.env`` file store
environment variables as they should be set when running CO\ *N*\ CEPT.

Both of these files are generated by the ``installer`` during installation.
Should you wish to not use the ``installer``, you should grab ``.paths`` and
``.env`` from the `online repository <https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept>`_ and
edit them manually.



The ``.paths`` file
...................
This is simply a Bash script of variable declarations, each variable storing
the absolute path to some file or directory. To install CO\ *N*\ CEPT without
the use of the ``installer`` script, you must manually set these paths.

From the comment above each variable, exactly what they refer to should be
obvious. An exception is the many ``mpi_*`` variables, which are explained
below:

- ``mpi_dir`` is the root directory for the MPI library, typically
  containing the ``bin``, ``lib`` and ``include`` subdirectories.

- ``mpi_compilerdir`` is the directory that contains the MPI C compiler,
  ``mpicc``.

- ``mpi_bindir`` is the directory that contains the MPI executable
  ``mpiexec``/``mpirun``.

- ``mpi_libdir`` is the directory that contains MPI library files, e.g.
  ``libmpi.so``.

- ``mpi_includedir`` is the directory that contains MPI header files, e.g.
  ``mpi.h``.

- ``mpi_symlinkdir`` is an optional directory in which to put symbolic links
  to MPI library files not present (or present under non-standard names) in
  ``mpi_libdir``, but needed when linking MPI programs. You do  not have to
  set this.

In CO\ *N*\ CEPT parameter files, all variables defined in the ``.paths``
file are available through the ``paths`` ``dict``. Thus, to e.g. get the
absoute path to the the ``output`` directory, you may use

.. code-block:: python3

   paths['output_dir']

in your parameter file.

You are free to define further paths (or even variables in general) in the
``.paths`` file, in which case they two will be available in parameter files
via the ``paths`` ``dict``.



The ``.env`` file
.................
This file is meant to set up the needed environment variables needed for
building and running CO\ *N*\ CEPT. It is sourced by the ``concept`` script
before building and running the code.

.. tip::

   Should you want the environment of your interactive shell to be populated
   with the environment variables defined in ``.env``, it is recommended to
   source the ``concept`` script, rather than the ``.env`` file. This is
   becasue the ``concept`` scritp further sets up the environment in ways that
   are not meant to be user defined. You may need to do this e.g. if
   invoking ``make`` directly.

The ``.env`` file is populated with ``PATH``-like environment variables
present during installation, if using the ``installer``. On a cluster, you
typically source scripts or load modules prior to the installation itself in
order to gain access to compilers and/or libraries. The intend is for the
``.env`` file to define all necessary environment variables, so that the same
sourcing or module loading does not have to be repeated manually before
running CO\ *N*\ CEPT.

If you are installing CO\ *N*\ CEPT without the use of the ``installer`` or
some crucial part of the environemnt was not picked up during the
installation, you may add it yourself to the ``.env`` file, i.e. place

.. code-block:: bash

   export name="value"

somewhere in ``.env`` to make the variable ``name`` with value ``value`` be
part of the global CO\ *N*\ CEPT environment.



``PATH``-like environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many environemnt variables (e.g. ``PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``) are
"``PATH``-like", meaning that their values are colon-separated substrings.
Such environemnt variables are potentially dangerous to overwrite, so
instead they are merely updated by either prepending or appending new
substrings to their present value, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   export PATH="/some/new/path:${PATH}"  # prepending
   export PATH="${PATH}:/some/new/path"  # appending

The above syntax is allowed in ``.env``. Equivalently, the
``pathenv_name_value_pairs_custom`` array variable may be used;

.. code-block:: bash

   pathenv_name_value_pairs_custom=(PATH "/some/new/path")

which either prepends or appends ``/some/new/path`` to ``PATH``, depending on
whether the ``concatenate`` variable in ``.env`` is set to ``prepend`` or
``append``.

Any such ``PATH``-like environment variables present during install time will
be placed in a similar array structure. Whether these are prepended or
appended to the preexisting values of the same ``PATH``-like environment
variables when building/running CO\ *N*\ CEPT is similarly determined by
``concatenate``.



The ``mpi_executor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``mpi_executor`` variable determines which program is resonsible for
launching CO\ *N*\ CEPT as an MPI program, when submitted as a job on a remote
cluster. You may leave this empty or undefined in which case a (hopefully)
suitable value will be determined by the ``concept`` script.

After submitting a remote CO\ *N*\ CEPT job, see the ``jobscript`` for the
chosen value of ``mpi_executor``.

See :ref:`this<chosing_an_mpi_executor>` troubleshooting entry for further
details.



The ``make_jobs`` environment variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``make_jobs`` variable is not present in the ``.env`` file by default, but
may be set in order to specify whether CO\ *N*\ CEPT should be built in
parallel. The default behavior is to build in parallel when working locally
and serially when working remotely. To overrule this, add one of e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   export make_jobs="-j 1"  # Always build serially
   export make_jobs="-j 2"  # Always build in parallel, using 2 cores
   export make_jobs="-j"    # Always build in parallel, using any number of cores

to ``.env``.
