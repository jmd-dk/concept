Introduction
------------
CO\ *N*\ CEPT is a free and open-source simulation code for cosmological
structure formation. The code should run on any Linux system, from massively
parallel computer clusters to laptops. The code is written almost exclusively
in Python, but achieves C-like performance through code transformation using a
custom transpiler/optimizer and `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__. While highly
competitive regarding both performance and accuracy, CO\ *N*\ CEPT further
strives for ease of use.

CO\ *N*\ CEPT is capable of simulating matter particles evolving under
self-gravity in an expanding background. It has multiple gravitational solvers
to choose from, and has adaptive time integration built in. In addition to
particles, the code is further able to evolve fluids at various levels of
non-linearity, providing the means for the inclusion of more exotic species
such as massive neutrinos, as well as for simulations consistent with general
relativistic perturbation theory. Various non-standard species --- such as
decaying cold dark matter --- are fully supported.

CO\ *N*\ CEPT comes with a sophisticated initial condition generator built in,
and can output snapshots, power spectra, bispectra and several
kinds of renders.

The `CLASS <http://class-code.net/>`__ code is fully integrated into
CO\ *N*\ CEPT, supplying the needed information for e.g. initial condition
generation and general relativistic corrections.
