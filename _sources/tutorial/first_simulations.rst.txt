Your first simulations
----------------------

The ``concept`` script
......................

In a terminal, navigate to the ``concept`` directory within your chosen
installation directory. Unless otherwise specified, all code examples to come
is meant to be executed from within this directory. Here you'll find the
various ``*.py`` files making up the code, as well as a few other files, the
most important of which is a script similarly named ``concept``,
used to launch the code.

Try invoking the script using

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --pure-python --local

This will fire up CO\ *N*\ CEPT, which should display a few lines of colorful
text before shutting back down. The ``--local`` option specifies that we wish
to run CO\ *N*\ CEPT on the local machine, as opposed to submitting the
simulation as a job on a remote cluster. If you *are* working locally, you may
omit the ``--local`` option, just as this tutorial will do from now on. If you
are working remotely, please add the ``--local`` option yourself to all future
invocations of the ``concept`` script. Later this tutorial covers how to submit
CO\ *N*\ CEPT jobs when :doc:`working on a cluster <working_remotely>`.

As we did not provide any parameters to CO\ *N*\ CEPT, it shut down
immediately. We can add parameters using the ``-c`` option, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -c 'initial_conditions = {"name": "matter", "species": "matter particles", "N": 32**3}' \
       -c 'a_begin = 0.02' \
       -c 'output_times = {"powerspec": 1}' \
       --pure-python

A simulation with :math:`N = 32^3` particles will now be run, with initial
conditions generated at a scale factor of :math:`a = 0.02` and a power
spectrum produced at :math:`a = 1`. Once completed, check the ``output``
directory, where you'll find the power spectrum data and plot.

The above simulation should take a couple of minutes. Now rerun the simulation,
this time without the ``--pure-python`` option. The simulation will be run in
*compiled* mode, as opposed to *pure Python* mode. You should see a dramatic
performance enhancement, in particular for the actual time stepping. For each
time step, the computation time is written in parentheses to the right. Also,
the last printed line of a simulation contains the total execution time.

.. note::

   When running CO\ *N*\ CEPT in compiled mode, the code base is first checked
   for edits since last compilation. If any edits are  detected, the necessary
   parts of the code will automatically be re-compiled before the simulation
   starts. You may try this out by updating the modification timestamp of e.g.
   the ``main`` module;

   .. code-block:: bash

      touch main.py

   and then invoking ``concept`` in compiled mode. Compilation takes a few
   minutes.




.. topic:: Log files

   The printed output of all CO\ *N*\ CEPT runs gets logged in the ``logs``
   directory. Each run (or *job*) gets a unique integer ID, which is also used
   as the filename for the logged output. The log filename of any CO\ *N*\ CEPT
   run is stated when the program starts, and the job ID is written again at
   the end. Also, the job ID is included in the header of the power spectrum
   data files.

   Using the logs, try comparing the time step and total timings for the pure
   Python and compiled run you just performed of the same simulation.

   .. tip::
      To view e.g. the logged output of CO\ *N*\ CEPT run 1 with proper
      coloring, use ``less -r logs/1``. Arrow keys to navigate, ``q`` to quit.

For running actual simulations, compiled mode is always preferable to pure
Python mode.



Don't forget about gravity
..........................
The reason for the rapid time stepping (and to the keen eye, a low power
spectrum) is because CO\ *N*\ CEPT does not assign forces implicitly.
We must explicitly state that the ``"matter"`` component is under the
influence of gravity, where ``"matter"`` is the arbitrary name we have given
to our matter particles:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -c 'initial_conditions = {"name": "matter", "species": "matter particles", "N": 32**3}' \
       -c 'a_begin = 0.02' \
       -c 'output_times = {"powerspec": 1}' \
       -c 'select_forces = {"matter": {"gravity": "p3m"}}'

Finally, *this* runs a full simulation. Also, the simulation time is once again
a few minutes. We can bring it down by replacing ``"p3m"`` with ``"pm"``.
which switches out the P³M method for the much faster but also (at small scales)
less accurate PM method.

Sticking to the PM method, we may want to increase the simuation size,
say to :math:`N = 64^3` particles. At the same time, let's make sure that the
mesh for the gravitational potential :math:`\varphi` has at least the same
number of cells:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -c 'initial_conditions = {"name": "matter", "species": "matter particles", "N": 64**3}' \
       -c 'a_begin = 0.02' \
       -c 'output_times = {"powerspec": 1}' \
       -c 'select_forces = {"matter": {"gravity": "pm"}}' \
       -c 'φ_gridsize = 64'

(yes, really copy the greek letter directly into your termianl. It'll be fine.)

.. note::
   The potential grid :math:`\varphi` is reused for power spectrum computations,
   and so ``φ_gridsize`` also determines the smallest scale at which power is
   measured.

The above simulation runs rather quickly. Were we to use ``"p3m"`` in place of
``"pm"``, the simulation time would would rise dramatically. Perhaps
surprisingly, when using the P³M method we may gain quite a bit of performance
by *increasing* the resolution of the potential grid,
using e.g. ``φ_gridsize = 128``. See for yourself!

Finally, we should of course make use of multiple CPU cores to further cut
down on the computation time. To run with e.g. 4 cores, execute

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -c 'initial_conditions = {"name": "matter", "species": "matter particles", "N": 64**3}' \
       -c 'a_begin = 0.02' \
       -c 'output_times = {"powerspec": 1}' \
       -c 'select_forces = {"matter": {"gravity": "p3m"}}' \
       -c 'φ_gridsize = 128' \
       -n 4
