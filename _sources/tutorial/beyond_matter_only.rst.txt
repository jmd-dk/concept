Beyond matter-only simulations
------------------------------
If you've followed this tutorial so far, you're now fully capable of using
CO\ *N*\ CEPT for running matter-only simulations. More fancy simulations ---
taking other species into account --- are also possible, as this section will
demonstrate.

To assess the effects resulting from including non-matter species, we shall
perform a slew of simulations throughout this section. As most effects are
small, we shall also learn how to crank up the precision, introducing several
new parameters. If you have no interest in any of this, feel free to skip this
section.

.. topic:: Introduction

   Though universes of interest may contain several different species, in
   cosmological *N*-body simulations we are typically interested in following
   the evolution of the matter component only, as this is the only component
   which is non-linear at cosmological scales. Even so, we may wish to not
   neglect the small gravitational effects on matter from the other, linear
   species. We can do this by solving the given cosmology (including the
   matter) in linear perturbation theory ahead of time, and then feed the
   linear gravitational field from all species but matter to the *N*-body
   simulation, applying the otherwise missing gravity as an external force.

   CO\ *N*\ CEPT uses the `CLASS <http://class-code.net/>`_ code to solve the
   linear perturbation equations. For details on how the linear perturbations
   are applied to the *N*-body particles during the simulation, we refer to
   the paper on
   ":doc:`Fully relativistic treatment of light neutrinos in ùòï-body simulations</publications>`".

We begin our exploration by performing a standard matter-only simulation, as
specified by the below parameter file:

.. code-block:: python3

   # Non-parameter helper variable used to control the size of the simulation
   _size = 192

   # Input/output
   initial_conditions = [
       # Non-linear matter particles
       {
           'species': 'matter',
           'N'      : _size**3,
       },
   ]
   for _species in _lin.split(','):
       if not _species:
           continue
       initial_conditions.append(
           # Linear fluid component
           {
               'species'        : _species.strip(),
               'gridsize'       : _size,
               'boltzmann order': -1,
           }
       )
   output_dirs = {
       'powerspec': paths['output_dir'] + '/' + basename(paths['params'])
   }
   output_bases = {
       'powerspec': f'powerspec_lin={_lin}'.replace(' ', ''),
   }
   output_times = {
       'powerspec': 2*a_begin,
   }

   # Numerical parameters
   boxsize = 4*Gpc

   # Cosmology
   H0      = 67*km/(s*Mpc)
   Œ©b      = 0.049
   Œ©cdm    = 0.27
   a_begin = 0.01

   # Physics
   select_forces = {
       'particles': {'gravity': ('p3m', 2*_size)},
       'fluid'    : {'gravity': 'pm'},
   }

   # Non-parameter helper variable used to specify linear components.
   # Should be supplied as a command-line argument.
   _lin = ''

As usual, save the parameters in e.g. ``params/tutorial`` and run the
simulation via

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -p params/tutorial

possibly with the addition of ``-n 4`` or some other number of processes.

A relatively large number of particles :math:`N = 192^3` is used in order to
increase the precision of the simulation. Our goal is to investigate the
effects from radiation perturbations, which are most pronounced at very large
scales and early times --- hence the large ``boxsize`` and early output time.
The unfamiliar parameter specifications will be explained in due time.

.. topic:: The hunt for high precision

   Investigating the resulting ``output/tutorial/powerspec_lin=_a=0.02.png``
   you should see a familiar looking simulation power spectrum: decently
   looking at intermediary :math:`k`, inaccurate at small :math:`k` and with
   obvious numerical artifacts at large :math:`k`. As we are interested in
   fine details at low :math:`k`, we need to improve the precision here. We
   can do so by adding

   .. code-block:: python3

      # Simulation options
      primordial_amplitude_fixed = True

   to the parameter file and rerunning the simulation. This has the effect of
   replacing the uncorrelated random amplitudes of the primordial noise used
   to generate the initial conditions with amplitudes that are all of the same
   size. With this change, ``powerspec_lin=_a=0.02.png`` should look much
   better at low :math:`k` (larger :math:`k` are not very affected by this,
   as here many more :math:`\vec{k}` with the same magnitude
   :math:`|\vec{k}|=k` goes into producing each data point (recorded in the
   ``modes`` column in the power spectrum data file), reducing errors arising
   due to small number statistics).

We expect the evolution of the *N*-body particles to be completely linear at
these large scales and early times, and so we may use the difference between
the simulation and linear power spectrum as a measure for the error in the
simulation. To better see this difference, we shall make use of the below
plotting script:

.. code-block:: python3

   import glob, os, re
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   this_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True)
   for filename in sorted(glob.glob(f'{this_dir}/powerspec*')):
       match = re.search(r'powerspec_lin=(.*)_a=[\d.]+$', filename)
       if not match:
           continue
       lin = match.group(1).replace(',', ', ').replace('+', ' + ')
       k, P_sim, P_lin = np.loadtxt(filename, usecols=(0, 2, 3), unpack=True)
       linestyle, zorder = ('--', 1) if '+' in lin else ('-', 0)
       axes[0].loglog(k, P_sim, linestyle, zorder=zorder, label=f'simulation with lin = {lin}')
       axes[1].semilogx(k, (P_sim/P_lin - 1)*100, linestyle, zorder=zorder)
   axes[0].loglog(k, P_lin, 'k--', label='linear')
   axes[1].semilogx(k, (P_lin/P_lin - 1)*100, 'k--')
   axes[0].legend()
   k_min, k_max = k[~np.isnan(P_lin)][[0, -1]]
   axes[0].set_xlim(k_min, 0.5*k_max)
   axes[0].set_ylim(0.9*np.nanmin(P_lin), 1.1*np.nanmax(P_lin))
   axes[1].set_ylim(-1, 1)
   axes[1].set_xlabel(r'$k$ $[\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}]$')
   axes[0].set_ylabel(r'$P\,[\mathrm{Mpc}^3]$')
   axes[1].set_ylabel(r'$P_{\mathrm{sim}}/P_{\mathrm{lin}}-1\,[\%]$')
   axes[0].tick_params('x', direction='inout', which='both')
   axes[0].set_zorder(np.inf)
   fig.tight_layout()
   fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0)
   fig.savefig(f'{this_dir}/plot.png')

Save the script as e.g. ``output/tutorial/plot.py`` and run it using

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -m output/tutorial/plot.py

This will produce ``output/tutorial/plot.png``, where the bottom panel shows
the relative error between the simulated power spectrum and that computed
using purely linear theory. They should agree to within a percent at the
lowest :math:`k`. At higher :math:`k` the agreement is worse. Though this can
be remedied by increasing the resolution of the simulation (i.e. by
increasing ``_size``), we shall not do so here, as we focus on the lower
:math:`k` only.

The power spectra outputted by the simulation are binned using a constant
linear bin size in :math:`k`. This is usually desirable, though higher
precision at the lowest :math:`k` can be achieved by leaving out this binning.
The bin size is controlled by the ``powerspec_binsize`` parameter. By setting
it to ``0`` we disable binning altogether. Add

.. code-block:: python3

   powerspec_binsize = 0

to the parameter file, then rerun the simulation and the plotting script.
Though the simulation power spectrum generally becomes more jagged, you should
observe better agreement with linear theory at low :math:`k`.



.. topic:: Including linear species

   With our high-precision setup established, we are ready to start
   experimenting with adding in the missing species to the simulation,
   hopefully leading to better agreement with linear theory on the largest
   scales. To keep the clutter within ``output/tutorial`` to a minimum, go
   ahead and add

   .. code-block:: python3

      powerspec_select = {
          'matter': {'data': True, 'plot': False},
      }

   to the parameter file before continuing.

   The inhomogeneities in the CMB causes a slight gravitational tug on matter,
   perturbing its evolution. To add this effect to the simulation, we need to
   add a photon component. This could look like (do not change the parameter
   file)

   .. code-block:: python3

      initial_conditions = [
          # Non-linear matter particles
          {
              'species': 'matter',
              'N'      : _size**3,
          },
          # Linear photon fluid
          {
              'species'        : 'photons',
              'gridsize'       : _size,
              'boltzmann order': -1,
          },
      ]

   We do not want to model the photons using *N*-body particles, but rather
   as a collection of spaially fixed grids, storing the energy density,
   momentum density, etc. This is referred to as the
   *fluid representation* --- as opposed to the *particle representation* ---
   and is generally preferable for non-linear components. To represent the
   photon component as a fluid, we specify ``'gridsize'`` in place of ``'N'``,
   where ``'gridsize'`` is the number of grid cells along each dimension, for
   the 3D Cartesian fluid grids. Finally, the number of fluid quantities ---
   and corresponding grids --- to take into account is implicitly specified
   by the *Boltzmann order*. As is `customary <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9506072>`_
   in linear perturbation theory, we transform the Boltzmann equation for a
   given species into an infinite hierarchy of multipole moments
   :math:`\ell \geq 0`. We then partition this hierarchy in two; a
   non-linear part :math:`\ell \leq \ell_{\text{nl}}` and a linear part
   :math:`\ell > \ell_{\text{nl}}`, where :math:`\ell_{\text{nl}}` is
   precisely the Boltzmann order. A few examples shall illuminate this
   concept:

   - **Bolzmann order 0**: The evolution equation for the lowest moment (i.e.
     the continuity equation for the energy density) is solved non-linearly
     during the simulation, while higher moments like momentum density (on
     which the energy density depends) are solved in pure linear theory.
   - **Boltzmann order 1**: The evolution equations for the two lowest moments
     (i.e. the continuity equation for the energy density and the Euler
     equation for the momentum density) are solved non-linearly during the
     simulation, while higher moments like pressure and shear (on which the
     energy and momentum density depend) are solved in pure linear theory.
   - **Boltzmann order -1**: None of the moments are treated non-linearly,
     i.e. this results in a purely linear component. Though the evolution of
     such a component is independent of the simulation, a purely linear
     component may still act with a force on other, non-linear components
     during the simulation.

   .. note::

      Though higher Boltzmann orders are well-defined, the largest Boltzmann
      order currently implemnted in CO\ *N*\ CEPT is 1.

   We shall look into Boltzmann orders different from -1 in the subsection on
   :ref:`non-linear massive neutrinos<nonlinear_massive_neutrinos>`. For now
   we shall keep to the purely linear case of Boltzmann order -1.

   For two components to have any affect on each other, they must both be
   registered with the same force in the ``select_forces`` parameter. Looking
   at this parameter in the parameter file, we see that both ``'particles'``
   and ``'fluid'`` components have been assigned gravity. For fluids, only the
   PM method with a grid size equal to the fluid grid size is sensible.

   The parameter file has already been set up to include optional linear fluid
   components, using the ``_lin`` command-line parameter. To perform a
   simulation with the inclusion of linear photons, run

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -p params/tutorial -c '_lin = "photons"'

   .. tip::

      Note that the ``_lin`` helper variable is defined at the bottom of the
      paramter file to have an empty value (leading to no linear species being
      included). As this is placed after all actual parameters, this defines a
      default value which is used when ``_lin`` is not given as a command-line
      parameter. As ``_size`` is defined at the top, supplying ``_size`` as a
      command-line parameter will have no effect.

   Now redo the plot, and the results of both the matter-only and the matter
   plus photon simulation should appear. The plot will show that --- sadly ---
   including the photons does *not* lead to better large-scale behavior.

   CO\ *N*\ CEPT deligates all linear (and background) computations to the
   CLASS code. Though we have specified :math:`H_0`, :math:`\Omega_{\text{b}}`
   and :math:`\Omega_{\text{cdm}}` in the parameter file, many cosmological
   parameters are still left unspecified. Here the default CLASS parameters
   are used, which in addition to baryons, cold dark matter and photons also
   contain massless neutrinos. With our hope renewed, let's run a simulation
   which include both linear photons and linear massless neutrinos:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -p params/tutorial -c '_lin = "photons, massless neutrinos"'

   To our horror, including the neutrinos made the disagreement between the
   simulation and linear theory even larger!

   The gravity applied to the non-linear matter particles from the linear
   photon and neutrino fluids is the *Newtonian* gravity, i.e. that which
   results from their energy densities. By contrast, the linear theory
   computation includes full general relativistic gravity, meaning that we
   have still to account for the gravitational effects due to the momentum
   density, pressure and shear of the photons and neutrinos. As this part of
   gravity amounts to a general relativistic correction, we shall refer to it
   as the *metric* contribution. That is, we invent a new numerical species,
   the metric, containing the collective non-Newtonian gravitational effects
   due to all physical species. As demonstrated in the paper on
   ":doc:`Fully relativistic treatment of light neutrinos in ùòï-body simulations</publications>`",
   this metric species might be numerically realized as a (fictitious) linear
   energy density field, the *Newtonian* gravity from which implements exactly
   the missing general relativistic corrections!

   .. note::

      For the metric species to be able to supply the correct force, the
      entire simulation must be performed in a particular gauge; the
      *N*-body gauge. That is, initial conditions for non-linear species
      as well as linear input during the simulation must all be in this gauge.
      This is the default (and only) mode of CO\ *N*\ CEPT. Note that all
      outputs are similarly in this gauge, including linear (CLASS) power
      spectra. Direct comparison to output from other *N*-body codes (which
      usually do not define a gauge at all) is perfectly doable, as the choice
      of gauge only becomes aparrent at very large scales.

   To finally run a simulation which include the gravitational effects from
   photons and neutrinos in their entirety, run

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -p params/tutorial -c '_lin = "photons, massless neutrinos, metric"'

   Replotting, you should see a much better behaved simulation power spectrum.



.. topic:: Combining species

   If you've read along in the terminal output during the simulations, you may
   have noticed that the energy density, :math:`\varrho`, of each of the
   linear species are realized in turn. We can save some time and memory by
   treating all linear species as a single, collective component. To specify
   this, we would normally write e.g.

   .. code-block:: python3

      initial_conditions = [
          # Non-linear matter particles
          {
              'species': 'matter',
              'N'      : _size**3,
          },
          # Linear fluid component
          {
              'species'        : 'photons + massless neutrinos + metric',
              'gridsize'       : _size,
              'boltzmann order': -1,
          },
      ]

   Using our clever parameter file however, we may of course specify this
   directly at the command-line using

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -p params/tutorial -c '_lin = "photons + massless neutrinos + metric"'

   This idea of combining species is embraced fully by CO\ *N*\ CEPT. As such,
   the species ``'photons + massless neutrinos'`` may be collectively referred
   to simply as ``'radiation'``. Thus,

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -p params/tutorial -c '_lin = "radiation + metric"'

   works just as well. You should run one of the above and check that you
   obtain the same result as before.

   You are in fact already very familiar with the idea of combining species,
   as ``'matter'`` really means ``'baryons + cold dark matter'``.

   .. tip::

      When performing simulaitons in a cosmology without massless neutrinos,
      specifying ``'photons + massless neutrinos'`` as the species of a
      component will produce an error. However, specfying ``'radiation'`` is
      always safe, as this dynamically maps to the set of all radiation
      species present in the current cosmology, whatever this may be.
      Similarly, ``'matter'`` is safe to use even in a cosmology without



.. topic:: Achieving perfection

   Though the final simulation power spectrum indeed appear well behaved
   at large scales, you might not --- after all this effort --- be happy about
   it disagreeing with linear theory at the 0.1% level. This remaining
   disagreement stems from numerical inaccuracy in the simulation, which we
   may remedy by lowering the time step size.

   The time step size is limited by a set of conditions/limiters, each
   classified as either a 'background' or 'non-linear' condition. The
   maximum allowed time step size within each category is scaled by the
   parameter ``Œît_base_background_factor`` and ``Œît_base_nonlinear_factor``,
   respectively. At the very linear times and scales with which we are
   currently operating, it's a safe bet that the maximum allowed time step is
   set by one of the background limiters.

   To make the time steps 10 times smaller than usually, place

   .. code-block:: python3

      Œît_base_background_factor = 0.1

   in the parameter file and rerun the full simulation. Note that this will
   not increase the total number of time steps (and thus the computation time)
   by a factor of 10, as the time step is periodically increased (though
   always in accordance to ``Œît_base_background_factor`` and
   ``Œît_base_nonlinear_factor``).

   With this last tweak, the simulation power spectrum should agree with
   linear theory far better than 0.1%, at the largest scales. Incidentally,
   you may increase the output time all the way to :math:`a = 1` while
   retaining excellent agreement with linear theory. Keeping the time steps
   small, such simulations takes a long time however.
