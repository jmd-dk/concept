Tutorial
========
This tutorial is intended to get you up and running with CO\ *N*\ CEPT,
without too many long explanations along the way.

The tutorial consists of multiple sections as listed below. Sections
:doc:`1 <installation>`\ --\ :doc:`6 <working_remotely>` cover the basics, with
section :doc:`6 <working_remotely>` only being relevant if you work on a
remote cluster. You should go through these in order, as they build upon each
other.

The remaining sections :doc:`7 <beyond_matter_only>`\ --\ :doc:`9 <gadget>`
stand on their own, each tackling some advanced subject, all of which may not
be of interest to any given user. Though these sections are largely
independent, the meaning of newly introduced parameters will be discussed only
at their first appearance, across all sections.
