Command-line options
====================
This page elaborates on the many options to the ``concept`` script, used to
launch CO\ *N*\ CEPT.

If you have yet to play around with the ``concept`` script, you are advised to
take the :doc:`tutorial </tutorial/first_simulations>`.

Most options have a short and a long format --- e.g. ``-h`` and ``--help`` ---
which always does the same thing. Some however only have the long format. When
using the long format, you do not have to spell out the entire option, as long
as the first part uniquely identifies the full option. For example, ``--he``
may be used in place of ``--help``.

Many options require a value, e.g. ``-n 2`` or equivalently
``--nprocs 2``. Instead of a space, the option name and value may be separated
by an equal sign; ``-n=2`` or ``--nprocs=2``.

The command-line options are grouped into four categories as listed below.
Underneath each category heading, a new facet of the ``concept`` script is
described, which might be of interest even if you do not want to study each
option in detail.

   :depth: 2



.. _basics:

Basics
------
The following basic command-line options are all you need to know in order to
run CO\ *N*\ CEPT simulations locally.



Help: ``-h``, ``--help``
........................
Displays a short description of each command-line option and exits:

.. code-block::

   ./concept -h

This is helpful if you have forgotten the name of some particular option. For
learning about the usage of a given option, this page is much preferable.



.. _parameter_file:

Parameter file: ``-p``, ``--params``
....................................
Specifies the parameter file to use:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -p </path/to/parameter-file>

The path may be specified in any of these formats:

* Absolutely.
* Relative to your current working directory.
* Relative to the CO\ *N*\ CEPT installation directory.
* Relative to the ``param`` directory.

Typically, parameter files are kept in the ``param`` directory. With the
parameter file ``my_param`` located in this directory, specifying the use
of this parameter file may then look like e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -p param/my_param

The many possible parameters to put inside parameter files are each described
in the sections under :doc:`Parameters </parameters/parameters>`. Parameters
absent from the supplied parameter file will take on default values. Leaving
out the ``-p`` parameter file specification when invoking ``concept``, *all*
parameters take on their default values, which does not result in an actual
simulation as no output is specified by default.



.. _command_line_parameters:

Command-line parameters: ``-c``, ``--command-line-params``
..........................................................
Directly specifies parameters to use, without referring to a parameter file.
E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -c "boxsize = 512*Mpc"

Often this is used in combination with a parameter file, e.g. if a suite of
similar simulations is to be run where only a few parameter values change
between the simulations. E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   # First simulation
   ./concept \
       -p param/my_param \
       -c "Ωb = 0.049" \
       -c "Ωcdm = 0.270"

   # Second simulation
   ./concept \
       -p param/my_param \
       -c "Ωb = 0.048" \
       -c "Ωcdm = 0.271"

Note that the ``-c`` option may be specified multiple times.

Specifying command-line parameters while also making use of a parameter file
is equivalent to having the command-line parameters defined *at the bottom* of
the parameter file. Despite of this, the command-line parameters will become
available both during the simulation *and* to the other parameters in the
parameter file during read-in.

.. caution::
   Be careful about trying to overwrite parameter values defined in a
   parameter file using ``-c``. As stated above, specifying a command-line
   parameter with ``-c`` is equivalent to defining it at the bottom of the
   parameter file, which makes it take on the command-line value at the top of
   the parameter file and down until the parameter is (re)assigned (see
   :doc:`non-linear parsing of parameter file content </parameters/parameters>`
   for how this works). During the actual simulation, the value given by
   ``-c`` will be used.

   For a completely stand-alone parameter with no other parameters depending
   on its value, there is then no danger in overwriting its value using
   ``-c``. It might not be obvious whether a given parameter is stand-alone
   or not, and so it is generally cleaner to just not have any parameters be
   defined both in the parameter file and on the command-line.



.. _number_of_processes:

Number of processes: ``-n``, ``--nprocs``
.........................................
Specifies the number of MPI processes to use, with each MPI process being
mapped to its own CPU core (assuming enough of these are available). To run
using e.g. 8 processes:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -n 8

If not specified, this defaults to 1.

You may write the number of processes as a (Python 3) expression. All of these
specifies that 8 processes should be used:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -n 2*4
   ./concept -n 2**3
   ./concept -n "3 + 5"



.. _specifying_multiple_nodes:

Specifying multiple nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When running on a cluster with multiple compute nodes, you may also specify
the number of nodes to be used. The following examples all specify 8 MPI
processes distributed over 2 nodes each with 4 CPU cores:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -n 2:4
   ./concept -n 2:2*2
   ./concept -n "2 2*2"
   ./concept -n "1 + 1 : 2**2"

Note that inhomogeneous layouts are not describable. If you leave out the node
specification (i.e. only supply a single number to ``-n``) and the cluster is
running Slurm, the specified total number of CPU cores may be distributed in
any which way between the available nodes. If the cluster is running
TORQUE/PBS, you must always explicitly specify the number of nodes as well as
the number of CPU cores/node.



Utility: ``-u``, ``--utility``
..............................
Signals that one of the CO\ *N*\ CEPT utilities is to be run instead of a
simulation. To run e.g. the ``powerspec`` utility, do

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -u powerspec </path/to/snapshot>

which will then produce a power spectrum of the snapshot file located at
``</path/to/snapshot>``.

Each utility comes with its own command-line options (for the ``powerspec``
utility, a required path to a snapshot), which you should specify together
with the normal ``concept`` command-line options. In the case of the
``powerspec`` utility, this could look like

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -n 4 -u powerspec </path/to/snapshot>
   # or
   ./concept -u powerspec </path/to/snapshot> -n 4

both of which will produce a power spectrum of the snapshot using 4 processes.
Some utilities have elaborate command-line interfaces of their own. Brief
summaries gets printed if you do e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -u powerspec -h

You can also read about the different utilities and their command-line
interfaces under :doc:`Utilities </utilities/utilities>`.

Many utilities further make use of the standard ``concept`` command-line
options, like ``-n`` to set the number of processes as in the example above,
or ``-p`` to specify a parameter file to use.

While some utilities are always run locally, the ones that potentially
involves large computational resources are subject to the same
:ref:`remote submission behaviour <remote_job_submission>` as standard
simulations.



.. _remote_job_submission:

Remote job submission
---------------------
When running CO\ *N*\ CEPT on a cluster with a job scheduler (Slurm and
TORQUE/PBS supported), each invocation of ``concept`` submits the work to be
done as a remote job (unless this behaviour is :ref:`overruled <local>`). If
running locally, none of these options have any effect.

On top of the :ref:`basic <basics>` options, the options below are used for
additional resource specification when submitting remote jobs. Note that
additional possibilities arise for the ``-n`` option when running on a cluster
with multiple compute nodes, as documented
:ref:`above <specifying_multiple_nodes>`.



.. _queue:

Queue: ``-q``, ``--queue``
..........................
Specifies the name of the queue (called 'partition' in Slurm) to which the
remote job is to be submitted:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -q <queue>

If using Slurm, you can specify multiple queues:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -q <queue1>,<queue2>,<queue3>

No remote job will be submitted if you do not supply this option. A job script
will however be produced, which you may edit and submit manually.



.. _walltime:

Wall time: ``-w``, ``--walltime``
.................................
Specifies the maximum wall time (total computation time) within which the
remote job has to have completed. If the job runs for the entire specified
maximum wall time, it will be killed by the job scheduler.

You have a lot of freedom in how you want to express this time:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -w 2:30:00       #  2 hours and 30 minutes
   ./concept -w 45min         #              45 minutes
   ./concept -w 100m          #  1 hour  and 40 minutes
   ./concept -w "3 days"      # 72 hours
   ./concept -w 3:12:00:00    # 84 hours
   ./concept -w "2d + 7.5hr"  # 55 hours and 30 minutes

If not specified, the system typically sets some default wall time.



.. _memory:

Memory: ``--memory``
....................
Specifies the amount of memory allocated for the remote job. If you assign
insufficient memory to a job, it will be killed (usually with a somewhat
cryptic error message) by the system once its memory needs exceed the
specified amount.

Examples of memory specifications:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --memory 4GB     #   4 gigabytes
   ./concept --memory 2048MB  #   2 gigabytes
   ./concept --memory 8*2GB   #  16 gigabytes
   ./concept --memory 0.5*TB  # 512 gigabytes
   ./concept --mem 8G         #   8 gigabytes

Note that the specified memory is the total memory available to the job, to be
shared amongst all MPI processes / CPU cores, even when running on multiple
compute nodes.

If not specified, the system typically sets some default memory limit.



Job name: ``--job-name``
........................
Specify a name for the job, used by the job scheduler:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --job-name "my job"

This name then shows up when listing your current jobs (i.e. via ``squeue`` in
Slurm and via ``qstat`` in TORQUE/PBS). If not specified, the default name
'``concept``' will be used. Having several jobs with the same name is not a
problem, as this name is not a replacement for the job ID.



Job directive: ``-j``, ``--job-directive``
..........................................
The specifications of system resources --- the designated
:ref:`queue(s) <queue>`, the
:ref:`number of nodes and processes <number_of_processes>`, the allowed
:ref:`wall time <walltime>` and the allocated :ref:`memory <memory>` --- gets
saved as 'job directives' within a job script, which is then submitted to the
job scheduler. If you desire further fine tuning of system resources, you may
supply further such directives using this command-line option.

What job directives are available depend on the job scheduler, as well as the
local configuration of the cluster and queue. As an example, consider

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -j="--exclusive"

which tells Slurm to give the job exclusive access to the allocated nodes, so
that the nodes will not be shared with other running jobs which could otherwise
make use of still available resources.

The effect of this is simply to place the line

   #SBATCH \-\-exclusive

in the header of the job script --- assuming Slurm --- or

   #PBS \-\-exclusive

in the case of TORQUE/PBS (the specific example of ``--exclusive``
does not mean anything to TORQUE/PBS, though).

.. caution::
   Since the value ``--exclusive`` starts with '``-``', using
   ``-j --exclusive`` or ``-j "--exclusive"`` is not legal as the
   parser registres ``--exclusive`` as a whole new (and non-existent)
   option to the ``concept`` script.

The ``-j`` option may be specified multiple times.



No watching: ``--no-watching``
..............................
After submitting a remote job, rather than put you back at the system prompt,
CO\ *N*\ CEPT will run the :doc:`watch utility </utilities/watch>` in order
for you to follow the progression of the job. This have no effect on the job
itself, and you may stop watching its printout using ``Ctrl``\ +\ ``C``.

If you have no desire to watch the job progression, you may specify this
option:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --no-watching

in which case the watch utility will not be run at all.



.. _other_modes_of_building_running:

Other modes of building/running
-------------------------------
The following options change the way that CO\ *N*\ CEPT is built or run.

While the Python source code for CO\ *N*\ CEPT lives in the ``scr`` directory,
default invocation of the ``concept`` script launches a job that runs off of
a compiled build, placed in the ``build`` directory. If changes to the source
is detected, the code is recompiled, updating the contents of ``build``. With
the compiled code ready, the requested CO\ *N*\ CEPT run is performed.
In addition, when working on a remote server/cluster (through SSH),
rather than starting the run directly, it is submitted as a remote job.



.. _local:

Local: ``--local``
...................
Supply this option to disregard the fact that you are running on a remote
server/cluster. That is, do not submit the CO\ *N*\ CEPT run as a remote job
using the job scheduler, but run it directly as if you were running locally.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --local



.. _pure_python:

Pure Python: ``--pure-python``
..............................
When this option is supplied, CO\ *N*\ CEPT is run directly off of the Python
source files in ``src``, disregarding the presence of
any :ref:`build <build>`:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --pure-python

While handy for development, running actual simulations in pure Python mode
is impractical due to an enormous performance hit.



.. _build:

Build: ``-b``, ``--build``
..........................
Specifies a build directory to use:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -b my_build

If a build already exists in this directory and is up-to-date with the source
in ``src``, it will be used. Otherwise the code will be (re)build within this
directory. If not specified, the ``build`` directory will be used.

This option is handy if you need to maintain several builds of the code, e.g.
for different queues consisting of nodes with different
hardware architectures.

When working on a cluster, the building of the code will take place as part of
the remote job, i.e. on the compute nodes and not the front-end. Using a
designated build directory for a given queue / set of nodes, it is then safe
to apply architecture-dependent,
:ref:`native optimizations <native_optimizations>`.

Moreover, Bash variable expansion *at runtime* is supported, making it
possible to use a temporary scratch directory for the build. Say your cluster
creates a designated ``/scratch/<ID>`` for every job and it uses Slurm,
you could then run CO\ *N*\ CEPT as

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -b '/scratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID'

making use of the Slurm variable ``SLURM_JOB_ID``, holding the job ID.

.. caution::
   Note the use of single-quotes above. Were we to do

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept -b "/scratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID"

   it would not work, as ``$SLURM_JOB_ID`` would be expanded right there on
   the command-line, where it does not hold a value.



.. _rebuild:

Rebuild: ``--rebuild``
......................
Even if the compiled code in the :ref:`build <build>` directory is up-to-date
with the source in ``src``, a rebuild can be triggered by using

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --rebuild True

Conversely, an out-of-date build will be used as is if you specify

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --rebuild False

Specifying just ``--rebuild`` is equivalent to ``--rebuild True``.



.. _native_optimizations:

Native optimizations: ``--native-optimizations``
................................................
The default optimizations performed during compilation are all portable, so
that the compiled code may be run on different hardware (within reason).

Supply this option if you are willing to use non-portable optimizations native
to your particular system, by which it is possible to squeeze a further few
percent performance increase out of the compilation:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --native-optimizations

Specifically, this adds the ``-march=native`` compiler optimization.

If working on a cluster with nodes of different architectures, having separate
build directories for these is recommended if building with native
optimizations. See the :ref:`build <build>` option for details.

.. note::
   If the :ref:`build <build>` directory already contains compiled code that
   is up-to-date with the source at ``src`` (built with or without
   native optimizations), the code will not be rebuild. To rebuild with native
   optimizations, you can make use of the :ref:`rebuild <rebuild>` option:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept --native-optimizations --rebuild



.. _no_link_time_optimizations:

No link time optimizations: ``--no-lto``
........................................
Link time optimizations (LTO) are on by default when compiling CO\ *N*\ CEPT,
if supported by the compiler. Though preferable, the associated increase in
build time and especially memory may be undesirable. To build CO\ *N*\ CEPT
without link time optimizations, supply this option:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --no-lto

.. note::
   If the :ref:`build <build>` directory already contains compiled code that
   is up-to-date with the source at ``src`` (built with or without LTO),
   the code will not be rebuild. To rebuild without LTO, you can make use of
   the :ref:`rebuild <rebuild>` option:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept --no-lto --rebuild



.. _no_optimizations:

No optimizations: ``--no-optimizations``
........................................
During compilation of CO\ *N*\ CEPT, a lot of optimizations are performed.
These include source code transformations performed by ``pyxpp.py`` as well
as standard C compiler optimizations (including
:ref:`LTO <no_link_time_optimizations>`), applied in the ``Makefile``. Though
these optimizations should not be disabled under normal circumstances, you may
do so by supplying this option:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --no-optimizations

.. note::
   If the :ref:`build <build>` directory already contains compiled code that
   is up-to-date with the source at ``src`` (built with or without
   optimizations), the code will not be rebuild. To rebuild without
   optimizations, you can make use of the :ref:`rebuild <rebuild>` option:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./concept --no-optimizations --rebuild



Unsafe building: ``--unsafe-building``
......................................
By default the compilation process is carried out in a safe manner, meaning
that changes within a file triggers recompilation of all other files which
rely on the specific file in question. If you know that a change is entirely
internal to the given file, you may save yourself some compilation time by
supplying this option, in which case all interdependencies between the files
are ignored during compilation:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept --unsafe-building

.. caution::
   This option really *is* unsafe and may very well lead to a buggy build. To
   clean up after an unsuccessful build, use the :ref:`rebuild <rebuild>`
   option or remove the ``build`` directory entirely using

   .. code-block:: bash

      (source concept && make clean)



.. _specials:

Specials
--------
The following options are mostly useful for development. As demonstrated by
the below examples though, "development" does not have to be restricted to the
CO\ *N*\ CEPT code itself. That is, these special options come in handy should
you wish to hook into the code, or simply check that the code is in a working
state.



.. _test:

Test: ``-t``, ``--tests``
.........................
CO\ *N*\ CEPT comes with an integration test suite, located in the
``test`` directory. Each subdirectory within this directory implements a given
test, with the test name given by the name of the subdirectory. You may use
this option to run these tests, checking that the code works correctly.

To run e.g. the ``concept_vs_gadget_p3m`` test --- which runs a small
CO\ *N*\ CEPT P³M simulation and a (supposedly) equivalent GADGET-2 TreePM
simulation, after which it compares the results --- do e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -t test/concept_vs_gadget_p3m

The path to the test may be specified in any of these formats:

* Absolutely.
* Relative to your current working directory.
* Relative to the CO\ *N*\ CEPT installation directory.
* Relative to the ``test`` directory.

Tests are always performed locally, i.e. not submitted as remote jobs even
when working on a remote cluster/server.

Once a test is complete, it will report either success or failure. Most
tests also produce some artefacts within their subdirectory, most notably
plots. You can clean up these artefacts by running the ``clean`` script within
the corresponding test subdirectory, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   test/concept_vs_gadget_p3m/clean

The entire test suite may be run using

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -t all

which runs each test sequentially. If one of the tests fails, the process
terminates immediately. To clean up after all tests, i.e. run the ``clean``
script within each subdirectory of the ``test`` directory, do

.. code-block:: bash

   (source concept && make clean-test)

.. note::
   When testing with an initially clean ``job`` directory, any warnings
   produced by tests will count as errors, leading to test failure. This
   behaviour is not present if starting from a non-empty ``job`` directory.



.. _main_entry_point:

Main entry point: ``-m``, ``--main``
....................................
The responsibilities of the ``concept`` script are to set up the environment,
build the actual CO\ *N*\ CEPT code (if not running in
:ref:`pure Python mode <pure_python>`) and then launch a job (or submit a
remote job which then is launched from within a generated job script).
Skipping over many details, this final launch step looks something like

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m build/main.so  # compiled mode
   python src/main.py       # pure Python mode

which fires up the ``main`` module, which in turn initiates the simulation.
We can use this option to switch out the default ``main`` module for some
other main entry point.

As an example, consider the ``hubble.py`` script below:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: hubble.py
   :name: hubble

   from commons import *  # import everything from the CO𝘕CEPT commons module

   h = H0/(100*units.km/(units.s*units.Mpc))
   print(f'{h = :g}')

We can run this script using

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -m hubble.py \
       --pure-python

.. note::
   Here we need :ref:`pure Python mode <pure_python>` since the ``hubble.py``
   script itself is not compiled, and the compiled ``commons`` module does
   not expose ``H0`` as a Python-level object.

To see that this really does hook into the CO\ *N*\ CEPT machinery:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -m hubble.py \
       -c "H0 = 72*km/(s*Mpc)" \
       --pure-python

Using ``-m`` with a script as above is convenient for e.g. making plotting
scripts which need access to some CO\ *N*\ CEPT functionality. For small
printouts, we can specify the Python code directly as the value to ``-m``. To
e.g. get the value of the gravitational constant implemented in CO\ *N*\ CEPT,
we can do

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -m "from commons import *; \
           unit = units.m**3/(units.kg*units.s**2); \
           print(f'{G_Newton/unit:g}'); \
       " \
       --pure-python \
   | tail -n 1



Interactive: ``-i``, ``--interactive``
......................................
Normally when running ``concept``, you are send back to the system prompt once
the run has completed. You can use this option to instead end up in a live
Python prompt, with the :ref:`main <main_entry_point>` scope available for
exploration and further execution.

You could run a simulation interactively if you wanted to:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept \
       -c "a_begin = 0.1" \
       -c "initial_conditions = {'species': 'matter', 'N': 16**3}" \
       -i \
       --pure-python

.. code-block:: python

   >>> output_times['a']['render2D'] = render2D_times['a'] = (1, )
   >>> timeloop()

where ``>>>`` indicates input which should be typed at the interactive Python
prompt. We use :ref:`pure Python mode <pure_python>` as our interactive
commands are interpreted directly by Python.

.. note::
   At least when using the standard
   :ref:`main entry point <main_entry_point>`, running in interactive mode
   using :ref:`more than one process <number_of_processes>` is not a good
   idea, as the interactive prompt is attached to the master process only.

While the above example requires knowledge of the internal code and serves no
real use outside of development, a perhaps more useful usage of interactive
mode is to combine it with :ref:`\\\\-\\\\-main <main_entry_point>` when
writing auxiliary scripts, or to use it purely exploratory. Say we did not
know the variable name and value of the gravitational constant implemented in
CO\ *N*\ CEPT, an we wanted to find out. We might go exploring, doing
something like

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -i --pure-python

.. code-block:: python

   >>> # 💭 What variables are available?
   >>> dir()

   >>> # 💭 I see one called 'G_Newton'
   >>> G_Newton

   >>> # 💭 Its value looks unrecognisable! It must not be given in SI units.
   >>> # 💭 I see something called 'units'.
   >>> units
   >>> units.m
   >>> units.Mpc

   >>> # 💭 What if I try ...
   >>> G_Newton/(units.m**3/(units.kg*units.s**2))

   >>> # 💭 Success!



Version: ``-v``, ``--version``
..............................
Prints out the version of CO\ *N*\ CEPT that is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./concept -v
