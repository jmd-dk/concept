# Help text which gets printed if invoked with -h or --help.
help_text='This script downloads and installs the CO𝘕CEPT code with all its
dependencies.

Below you will find a short description of how to run this script.
This is more thoroughly documented in the CO𝘕CEPT documentation:
https://jmd-dk.github.io/concept/installation.html

If run without an argument, this script will prompt for an
installation directory. Alternatively, this directory can be passed as
an argument. Everything will be installed within this directory.

Options taken by this script:
-h, --help             Show this help message and exit.
-t, --tests            Test the various dependency programs after their
                       individual installations. CO𝘕CEPT itself will similarly
                       be tested. On failure (fatal or non-fatal) of any test,
                       a log file of the test output will be placed in the
                       installation subdirectory of the given program. Any
                       test failures will be reported at the end of the entire
                       installation process.
-y, --yes_to_defaults  Accept default options on future queries. These include
                       system-wide installations of system dependencies (e.g.
                       gcc), should they be missing, as well as termination of
                       already running CO𝘕CEPT installation process, should
                       one exist.
--fix-ssh              Set up the ~/.ssh directory so that it allows for
                       password-less SSH login between nodes. This may be
                       needed in order to run multi-node MPI computations on
                       clusters. The original state of the ~/.ssh directory
                       will be backed up. Note that this option will perform
                       the changes to ~/.ssh only; no actual installation will
                       take place.
--slim                 Trim down the installation in order to save disk space.
                       This removes uncritical content from all installed
                       dependency programs and CO𝘕CEPT itself.

The full invocation signature of this script thus looks like
  /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
or
  /path/to/installer --fix-ssh
where brackets indicate optional arguments.

The system dependencies mentioned above consist of the following
(GNU implementations, specifically):
  - awk
  - gcc
  - g++
  - gfortran
  - grep
  - gzip
  - make
  - sed
  - tar
  - wget
  - glibc
  - as and ld
  - Linux headers
If any of these are missing, an attempt will be made to locate the
package manager on the system. If successful, you will be prompted to install
the missing system dependency, which will require root access.

The only system dependencies needed but not installed are the GNU core
utilities and Bash. This script (and others used in CO𝘕CEPT) should be
compatible with Bash version 3.0 or later.

The programs which will be installed into the specified installation
directory consist of the following and will be installed in order:
  - zlib (needed by HDF5, Python)
  - GSL
  - Perl (needed by OpenSSL, OpenBLAS, MPICH/OpenMPI)
  - MPICH/OpenMPI
  - HDF5
  - FFTW
  - FreeType (needed by Matplotlib)
  - ncurses  (needed by _curses, which is needed by blessings)
  - OpenSSL  (needed by pip)
  - libffi   (needed by _ctypes, which is needed by pip)
  - OpenBLAS (needed by SciPy, used by NumPy)
  - Python, with the following packages
    (along with their own Python package dependencies):
      - pip, setuptools, wheel (if any of the below)
      - Blessings
      - Cython
      - CythonGSL
      - NumPy
      - SciPy
      - Matplotlib
      - MPI4Py
      - H5Py
      - Sphinx
      - Sphinx-copybutton
      - Sphinx_rtd_theme
      - Sphinx-tabs
  - CO𝘕CEPT
  - CLASS
  - FFTW 2 (needed by GADGET)
  - GADGET

Due to the numerosity of the above list, the installation process will take
about an hour or two on modern hardware. The installation time depend strongly
on whether make is allowed to build in parallel or not. When running locally
(i.e. not over SSH), the default is to build in parallel using all available
CPU cores. Conversely, when running remotely the default is to build serially.
You can overwrite these defaults by setting the `make_jobs`
environment variable. E.g. to build in parallel using up to 4 CPU cores,
invoke this script as
  make_jobs="-j 4" /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]

The installation time is significantly increased when invoked with -t.
Note that the Python test suite will be run even when invoked without -t,
as this is done as part of the profile guided optimization used to make
the resultant Python interpreter faster.

By default, any pre-installed software on the list above will be ignored.
No conflicts should come of this. Should you still wish CO𝘕CEPT to use one such
pre-installed component, you can declare its directory path through the
`programname_dir` environment variable.
E.g. to use a pre-installedgsl library:
  gsl_dir=/path/to/gsl /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
The set of such environment variables correspond to the program names
above (using lower-case only), except for MPICH/OpenMPI and OpenBLAS, which
are just mpi_dir and blas_dir, respectively, as the specific MPI and BLAS
implementation does not matter.

When installing CO𝘕CEPT on a cluster, it is often preferable to make use of an
already installed MPI library (MPI standard 3, any implementation should do),
as this is (hopefully) properly configured with e.g. InfiniBand, which may not
be the case for the MPI installation produced by this script.
Thus on clusters it is adviced to use
  mpi_dir=/path/to/mpi /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
If you have /path/to/mpi/bin properly loaded into your PATH,
you can get by without specifying the MPI path explicitly using
  mpi_dir=$(which mpicc) /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
(Note that $(which mpicc) results in /path/to/mpi/bin/mpicc, not /path/to/mpi.
Though both are valid in this case,
generally you must specify precisely programname_dir=/path/to/programname.)

When not using a pre-installed MPI (i.e. when mpi_dir is not specified),
you may specify which MPI implementation to install --- either MPICH
or OpenMPI --- by setting the `mpi` environment variable to "mpich"
or "openmpi", respectively. E.g.
  mpi=openmpi /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
The default is MPICH.

Should you choose to use a pre-installed Python distribution
(by setting the python_dir variable), any missing Python packages
will be installed in this distribution. Pre-installed Python packages
will not be touched; e.g. if the installer wishes to install NumPy
1.10.4, but 1.10.3 is already installed, the package will not be
updated. If you want such Python package updates (or downgrades),
set the `pythonpackagename_install` environment variable to "True".
E.g. to overwrite a pre-installed NumPy package:
  numpy_install=True python_dir=/path/to/python /path/to/installer
If you choose to use a pre-installed Python distribution, it is your
responsibility that pip is installed as part of this distribution.
Also, if the blessings package is not pre-installed in the Python
distribution, Python should at least be compiled with the ncurses
library.

Should you choose to use a pre-installed GADGET (by setting the gadget_dir
variable), note that this must be placed in a directory to which you have
write (as well as read and execute, naturally) permissions and that CO𝘕CEPT
will make changes to the source files of GADGET during some tests.

Should you wish to install a specific version of some dependency
program, Python package or CO𝘕CEPT itself, simply set the environment
variable `programname_version` when invoking the installer.
E.g. to install GSL 2.4:
  gsl_version=2.4 /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]

When installing in a complicated environment with several available compilers
(typical for clusters) the installation time can be up to several times longer,
as for each program the installer tries out different compilers
and other options until a working configuration is found.
The available compilers located on the system will be printed out at the
beginning, in the precedence (order) of which they will be tried out.
You can choose this order yourself by setting the compiler_precedence
variable. To e.g. first try out Intel compilers and then GNU compilers:
  compiler_precedence="intel gnu" /path/to/installer [/path/to/concept] [-t] [-y]
All other compilers located will then be tried out after GNU. The complete
list of compilers in order of default precedence is "specified_mpi",
"default", "gnu", "clang", "mpi", "intel", "cray", "portland", "generic",
"unset". Here, "specified_mpi" means the MPI compiler provided by the MPI
library specified via mpi_dir, "default" means that we do not explicitly
alter the environment to specify any compiler (and so if e.g. $CC is defined,
this will probably be used), "mpi" means any MPI compiler (e.g. mpicc)
found on the system, "generic" refers to compilers not fitting into any
of the other categories (e.g. cc) and "unset" means that we explicitly
unset e.g. $CC.

Logs of the installation process are written to install_log (stdout)
and install_log_err (stderr) in the top installation directory.
Should the installation process end prematurely (e.g. due to network failure),
simply rerun this script with the same arguments and environment variables
as originally, and it will pick up the installation from where it left off.
