    """This function will do MPI communication. It will send the data in
    the array/memoryview block_send to the process of rank dest
    and receive data into array/memoryview block_recv from rank source.
    The arrays can be of any shape (currently bigger than 0 and less
    than 4) and size and may be different for the two.
    If block_recv is larger than the received data, the extra elements
    in the end will be filled with junk if the dimension of block_recv
    is larger than 1. Though for the sake of performance, always pass
    a fitting block_recv.
    The MPI function to use is specified in the mpifun argument
    (e.g. mpifun='sendrecv' or mpifun='send'). Uppercase communication
    (array communication) is always used, regardless of the case of the
    value of mpifun.
    For some MPI communications a root process should be specified.
    This can be set by the root argument.
    All arguments are optional, so that it is not needed to specify e.g.
    block_recv when doing a Send. For Cython to be able to compile this,
    a cython.pheader decorator is used (corresponding to cython.ccall
    or cpdef). Also, if a call to smart_mpi results in a receive but not
    a send, block_recv can be passed as the first argument
    instead of block_send (which is not used in this case).
    It is allowed not to pass in a block_recv, even when a message
    should be received. In that case, the recvbuf buffer will be used
    and returned.
    The received data can either be copied into block_recv (overwriting
    existing data) or it can be added to the existing data. Change
    this behaviour through the operation argument (operation='=' or
    operation='+=').
    If the passed blocks are contiguous, they will be used directly
    in the communication (though in the case of block_recv, only when
    operation='='). If not, contiguous buffers will be used. The
    buffers used are the variables sendbuf/sendbuf_mv and
    recvbuf/recvbuf_mv. These will be enlarged if necessary.
    Since the buffers contain doubles, the passed arrays must also
    contain doubles if the buffers are to be used. If communication can
    take place directly without the use of the buffers, the passed
    arrays may contain any type (though the type of the send and recv
    block should always be identical).
    What is returned depends on the choice of mpifun. Whenever a message
    should be received, the passed block_recv is returned (as block_recv
    is populated with values in-place, this is rarely used). When a
    non-blocking send-only is used, the MPI request is returned. When a
    blocking send-only is used, None is returned.
    If reverse is True, the communication is reversed, meaning that
    sending block_send to dist and receiving into block_recv from source
    turns into sending block_recv to source and receiving into
    block_send from dist.
