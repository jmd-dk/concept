    This function will update the momenta of all receiver components due

    - Interpolate the specified quantity of all supplier components

    - Transform to upstream Fourier slabs.
    - Perform deconvolution of upstream Fourier slabs of
      particle suppliers, if specified.

      slabs.
    - Convert the values of the global Fourier slabs to potential
      values, with the formula to use given by the 'potential' argument.
    - Obtain downstream potential Fourier slabs for each receiver.
      For particle receivers, another deconvolution is now performed due
      to the upcoming interpolation.
    - For receivers obtaining the force grid from the
      real-space potential:
      - Transform to real space downstream potentials.

        get the real space downstream force.

        Fourier space to obtain the downstream force grid
        in Fourier space.
      - Transform to real space downstream force grid.
    - Interpolate the real-space downstream force grid onto
